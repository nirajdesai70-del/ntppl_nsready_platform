## sample_event.json

This sample event uses:
- Full `parameter_key` format (`project:<uuid>:<name>`)
- Documentation UUIDs (`8212caa2-...`)

**NOTE (NS-AI-COMPAT & TESTS):**  
This sample event is intentionally aligned with the documentation UUIDs and full parameter_key format,  
so that developers, tests, SCADA, and future AI pipelines can all reuse the same example cleanly.
