## Why Archive?

These documents are archived because:
1. **Completed work** - The tasks they document are complete
2. **Historical reference** - Useful for understanding past decisions
3. **Not actively used** - No longer needed for daily operations
4. **Reduces clutter** - Keeps active documents easily accessible

---

## Accessing Archived Documents

All archived documents remain in git history and can be:
- Viewed directly in the archive directories
- Referenced in discussions about past work
- Used to understand project evolution
- Restored if needed (though unlikely)
